Overview\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrifing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\naccessible for a vast audience.\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\'person\'**. Avoid using more specific terms like \'mathematician\' or \'scientist\'  - **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as \'BECAME_PROFESSOR\', use more general and timeless relationship types like \'PROFESSOR\'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\nIf an entity, such as "John Doe", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., "Joe", "he"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use "John Doe" as the entity ID.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n## 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': 'Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Nazi Germany undertook several research programs relating to nuclear technology, including nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors, before and during World War II. These were variously called Uranverein (Uranium Club) or Uranprojekt (Uranium Project). The first effort started in April 1939, just months after the discovery of nuclear fission in Berlin in December 1938, but ended only a few months later, shortly ahead of the September 1939 German invasion of Poland, for which many notable German physicists were drafted into the Wehrmacht. A second effort under the administrative purview of the Wehrmacht\'s Heereswaffenamt began on September 1, 1939, the day of the invasion of Poland. The program eventually expanded into three main efforts: Uranmaschine (nuclear reactor) development, uranium and heavy water production, and uranium isotope separation. Eventually, the German military determined that nuclear fission would not contribute significantly to the war, and in January 1942 the Heereswaffenamt turned the program over to the Reich Research Council (Reichsforschungsrat) while continuing to fund the activity.\nThe program was split up among nine major institutes where the directors dominated research and set their own objectives. Subsequently, the number of scientists working on applied nuclear fission began to diminish as many researchers applied their talents to more pressing wartime demands. The most influential people in the Uranverein included Kurt Diebner, Abraham Esau, Walther Gerlach, and Erich Schumann. Schumann was one of the most powerful and influential physicists in Germany. Diebner, throughout the life of the nuclear weapon project, had more control over nuclear-fission research than did Walther Bothe, Klaus Clusius, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, or Werner Heisenberg. Esau was appointed as Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring\'s plenipotentiary for nuclear-physics research in December 1942, and was succeeded by Walther Gerlach after he resigned in December 1943.\nPoliticization of German academia under the Nazi régime of 1933–1945 had driven many physicists, engineers, and mathematicians out of Germany as early as 1933. Those of Jewish heritage who did not leave were quickly purged, further thinning the ranks of researchers. The politicization of the universities, along with  German armed forces demands for more manpower (many scientists and technical personnel were conscripted, despite possessing technical and engineering skills), substantially reduced the number of able German physicists.\nDevelopments took place in several phases, but in the words of historian Mark Walker, it ultimately became "frozen at the laboratory level" with the "modest goal" to "build a nuclear reactor which could sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction for a significant amount of time and to achieve the complete separation of at least tiny amount of the uranium isotopes". The scholarly consensus is that it failed to achieve these goals, and that despite fears at the time, the Germans had never been close to producing nuclear weapons. With the war in Europe ending in the spring of 1945, various Allied powers competed with each other to obtain surviving components of the German nuclear industry (personnel, facilities, and materiel), as they did with the pioneering V-2 SRBM program.\n\n\n== Discovery of nuclear fission ==\n\nIn December 1938, German chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann sent a manuscript to the German science journal Naturwissenschaften ("Natural Sciences") reporting that they had detected and identified the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons. Their article was published on 6 January 1939. On 19 December 1938, eighteen days before the publication, Otto Hahn communicated these results and his conclusion of a bursting of the uranium nucleus in a letter to his colleague and friend Lise Meitner, who had fled Germany in July to the Netherlands and then to Sweden.
