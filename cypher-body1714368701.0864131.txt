Overview\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrifing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\naccessible for a vast audience.\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\'person\'**. Avoid using more specific terms like \'mathematician\' or \'scientist\'  - **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as \'BECAME_PROFESSOR\', use more general and timeless relationship types like \'PROFESSOR\'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\nIf an entity, such as "John Doe", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., "Joe", "he"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use "John Doe" as the entity ID.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n## 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': 'Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Thorium-based nuclear power generation is fueled primarily by the nuclear fission of the isotope uranium-233 produced from the fertile element thorium. A thorium fuel cycle can offer several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycleâ€”including the much greater abundance of thorium found on Earth, superior physical and nuclear fuel properties, and reduced nuclear waste production. One advantage of thorium fuel is its low weaponization potential. It is difficult to weaponize the uranium-233 that is bred in the reactor. Plutonium-239 is produced at much lower levels and can be consumed in thorium reactors. \nAfter studying the feasibility of using thorium, nuclear scientists Ralph W. Moir and Edward Teller suggested that thorium nuclear research should be restarted after a three-decade shutdown and that a small prototype plant should be built.\nBetween 1999 and 2022, the number of operational thorium reactors in the world has risen from zero to a handful of research reactors, to commercial plans for producing full-scale thorium-based reactors for use as power plants on a national scale.\nAdvocates believe thorium is key to developing a new generation of cleaner, safer nuclear power. In 2011, a group of scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology assessed thorium-based power as "a 1000+ year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly sustainable energy sources solving a huge portion of mankind\'s negative environmental impact." However, development of thorium power has significant start-up costs. Development of breeder reactors in general (including thorium reactors, which are breeders by nature) will increase proliferation concerns. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nAfter World War II, uranium-based nuclear reactors were built to produce electricity. These were similar to the reactor designs that produced material for nuclear weapons.  During that period, the government of the United States also built an experimental prototype molten salt reactor (MSR) using U-233 fuel, the fissile material created by bombarding thorium with neutrons. The MSRE reactor, built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, operated critical for roughly 15,000 hours from 1965 to 1969. In 1968, Nobel laureate and discoverer of plutonium, Glenn Seaborg, publicly announced to the Atomic Energy Commission, of which he was chairman, that the thorium-based reactor had been successfully developed and tested.\nIn 1973, however, the US government settled on uranium technology and largely discontinued thorium-related nuclear research. The reasons were that uranium-fuelled reactors were more efficient, the research was proven and thorium\'s breeding ratio was thought insufficient to produce enough fuel to support development of a commercial nuclear industry.  As Moir and Teller later wrote, "The competition came down to a liquid metal fast breeder reactor (LMFBR) on the uranium-plutonium cycle and a thermal reactor on the thorium-233U cycle, the molten salt breeder reactor. The LMFBR had a larger breeding rate ... and won the competition."  In their opinion, the decision to stop development of thorium reactors, at least as a backup option, "was an excusable mistake".\nScience writer Richard Martin states that nuclear physicist Alvin Weinberg, who was director at Oak Ridge and primarily responsible for the new reactor, lost his job as director because he championed development of the safer thorium reactors. Weinberg himself recalls this period:\n\n[Congressman] Chet Holifield was clearly exasperated with me, and he finally blurted out, "Alvin, if you are concerned about the safety of reactors, then I think it may be time for you to leave nuclear energy." I was speechless. But it was apparent to me that my style, my attitude, and my perception of the future were no longer in tune with the powers within the AEC.\nMartin explains that Weinberg\'s unwillingness to sacrifice potentially safe nuclear power for the benefit of military uses forced him to retire:\n\nWeinberg realized that you co', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'frequency_penalty': NOT_GIVEN, 'function_call': NOT_GIVEN, 'functions': NOT_GIVEN, 'logit_bias': NOT_GIVEN, 'logprobs': NOT_GIVEN, 'max_tokens': NOT_GIVEN, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': NOT_GIVEN, 'response_format': NOT_GIVEN, 'seed': NOT_GIVEN, 'stop': NOT_GIVEN, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'DynamicGraph'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'DynamicGraph', 'description': 'Represents a graph document consisting of nodes and relationships.', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'nodes': {'description': 'List of nodes', 'type': 'array', 'items': {'description': 'Represents a node in a graph with associated properties.', 'type': 'object', 'properties': {'id': {'description': 'Name or human-readable unique identifier.', 'type': 'string'}, 'type': {'description': "The type or label of the node.Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\nFor example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'Person'**.
