Overview\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrifing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\naccessible for a vast audience.\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\'person\'**. Avoid using more specific terms like \'mathematician\' or \'scientist\'  - **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as \'BECAME_PROFESSOR\', use more general and timeless relationship types like \'PROFESSOR\'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\nIf an entity, such as "John Doe", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., "Joe", "he"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use "John Doe" as the entity ID.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n## 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': 'Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Nuclear reactor physics is the field of physics that studies and deals with the applied study and engineering applications of chain reaction to induce a controlled rate of fission in a nuclear reactor for the production of energy.\nMost nuclear reactors use a chain reaction to induce a controlled rate of nuclear fission in fissile material, releasing both energy and free neutrons.  A reactor consists of an assembly of nuclear fuel (a reactor core), usually surrounded by a neutron moderator such as regular water, heavy water, graphite, or zirconium hydride, and fitted with mechanisms such as control rods which control the rate of the reaction.\nThe physics of nuclear fission has several quirks that affect the design and behavior of nuclear reactors. This article presents a general overview of the physics of nuclear reactors and their behavior.\n\n\n== Criticality ==\nIn a nuclear reactor, the neutron population at any instant is a function of the rate of neutron production (due to fission processes) and the rate of neutron losses (due to non-fission absorption mechanisms and leakage from the system). When a reactor\'s neutron population remains steady from one generation to the next (creating as many new neutrons as are lost), the fission chain reaction is self-sustaining and the reactor\'s condition is referred to as "critical". When the reactor\'s neutron production exceeds losses, characterized by increasing power level, it is considered "supercritical", and when losses dominate, it is considered "subcritical" and exhibits decreasing power.\nThe "Six-factor formula" is the neutron life-cycle balance equation, which includes six separate factors, the product of which is equal to the ratio of the number of neutrons in any generation to that of the previous one; this parameter is called the effective multiplication factor k, also denoted by Keff, where  k =  Є Lf ρ Lth f η, where Є = "fast-fission factor", Lf = "fast non-leakage factor", ρ = "resonance escape probability", Lth = "thermal non-leakage factor", f = "thermal fuel utilization factor", and η = "reproduction factor". This equation\'s factors are roughly in order of potential occurrence for a fission born neutron during critical operation. As already mentioned before,  k = (Neutrons produced in one generation)/(Neutrons produced in the previous generation). In other words, when the reactor is critical, k = 1; when the reactor is subcritical, k < 1; and when the reactor is supercritical, k > 1.\nReactivity is an expression of the departure from criticality.  δk = (k − 1)/k.  When the reactor is critical, δk = 0.  When the reactor is subcritical, δk < 0.  When the reactor is supercritical, δk > 0.  Reactivity is also represented by the lowercase Greek letter rho (ρ). Reactivity is commonly expressed in decimals or percentages or pcm (per cent mille) of Δk/k. When reactivity ρ is expressed in units of delayed neutron fraction β, the unit is called the dollar.\nIf we write \'N\' for the number of free neutrons in a reactor core and \n  \n    \n      \n        τ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau }\n  \n for the average lifetime of each neutron (before it either escapes from the core or is absorbed by a nucleus), then the reactor will follow the differential equation (evolution equation)\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              N\n            \n            \n              d\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              α\n              N\n            \n            τ\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dN}{dt}}={\\frac {\\alpha N}{\\tau }}}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        α\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n  \n is a constant of proportionality, and \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n        N\n        \n          /\n        \n        d\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle dN/dt}\n  \n is the rate of change of the neutron count in the core.
