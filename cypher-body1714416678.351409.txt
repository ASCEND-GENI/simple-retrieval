Overview\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrifing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\naccessible for a vast audience.\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\'person\'**. Avoid using more specific terms like \'mathematician\' or \'scientist\'  - **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as \'BECAME_PROFESSOR\', use more general and timeless relationship types like \'PROFESSOR\'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\nIf an entity, such as "John Doe", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., "Joe", "he"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use "John Doe" as the entity ID.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n## 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': 'Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: In nuclear physics, a nuclear chain reaction occurs when one single nuclear reaction causes an average of one or more subsequent nuclear reactions, thus leading to the possibility of a self-propagating series or "positive feedback loop" of these reactions. The specific nuclear reaction may be the fission of heavy isotopes (e.g., uranium-235, 235U). A nuclear chain reaction releases several million times more energy per reaction than any chemical reaction.\n\n\n== History ==\nChemical chain reactions were first proposed by German chemist Max Bodenstein in 1913, and were reasonably well understood before nuclear chain reactions were proposed. It was understood that chemical chain reactions were responsible for exponentially increasing rates in reactions, such as produced in chemical explosions.\nThe concept of a nuclear chain reaction was reportedly first hypothesized by Hungarian scientist Leó Szilárd on September 12, 1933. Szilárd that morning had been reading in a London paper of an experiment in which protons from an accelerator had been used to split lithium-7 into alpha particles, and the fact that much greater amounts of energy were produced by the reaction than the proton supplied. Ernest Rutherford commented in the article that inefficiencies in the process precluded use of it for power generation. However, the neutron had been discovered by James Chadwick in 1932, shortly before, as the product of a nuclear reaction. Szilárd, who had been trained as an engineer and physicist, put the two nuclear experimental results together in his mind and realized that if a nuclear reaction produced neutrons, which then caused further similar nuclear reactions, the process might be a self-perpetuating nuclear chain-reaction, spontaneously producing new isotopes and power without the need for protons or an accelerator. Szilárd, however, did not propose fission as the mechanism for his chain reaction, since the fission reaction was not yet discovered, or even suspected. Instead, Szilárd proposed using mixtures of lighter known isotopes which produced neutrons in copious amounts. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple nuclear reactor the following year.\nIn 1936, Szilárd attempted to create a chain reaction using beryllium and indium, but was unsuccessful. Nuclear fission was discovered by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in December 1938 and explained theoretically in January 1939 by Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch. In their second publication on nuclear fission in February 1939, Hahn and Strassmann used the term Uranspaltung (uranium fission) for the first time, and predicted the existence and liberation of additional neutrons during the fission process, opening up the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction.\nA few months later, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, H. Von Halban and L. Kowarski in Paris searched for, and discovered, neutron multiplication in uranium, proving that a nuclear chain reaction by this mechanism was indeed possible.\nOn May 4, 1939, Joliot-Curie, Halban, and Kowarski filed three patents. The first two described power production from a nuclear chain reaction, the last one called Perfectionnement aux charges explosives was the first patent for the atomic bomb and is filed as patent No. 445686 by the Caisse nationale de Recherche Scientifique.\nIn parallel, Szilárd and Enrico Fermi in New York made the same analysis. This discovery prompted the letter from Szilárd and signed by Albert Einstein to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning of the possibility that Nazi Germany might be attempting to build an atomic bomb.\nOn December 2, 1942, a team led by Fermi (and including Szilárd) produced the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction with the Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1) experimental reactor in a racquets court below the bleachers of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. Fermi\'s experiments at the University of Chicago were part of Arthur H.
