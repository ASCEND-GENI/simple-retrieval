Overview\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrifing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\naccessible for a vast audience.\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\'person\'**. Avoid using more specific terms like \'mathematician\' or \'scientist\'  - **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as \'BECAME_PROFESSOR\', use more general and timeless relationship types like \'PROFESSOR\'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\nIf an entity, such as "John Doe", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., "Joe", "he"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use "John Doe" as the entity ID.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n## 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': 'Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: The B Reactor at the Hanford Site, near Richland, Washington, was the first large-scale nuclear reactor ever built. The project was a key part of the Manhattan Project, the United States nuclear weapons development program during World War II. Its purpose was to convert natural (not isotopically enriched) uranium metal into plutonium-239 by neutron activation, as plutonium is simpler to chemically separate from spent fuel assemblies, for use in nuclear weapons, than it is to isotopically enrich uranium into weapon-grade material. The B reactor was fueled with metallic natural uranium, graphite moderated, and water-cooled. It has been designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark since August 19, 2008 and in July 2011 the National Park Service recommended that the B Reactor be included in the Manhattan Project National Historical Park commemorating the Manhattan Project. Visitors can take a tour of the reactor by advance reservation.\n\n\n== Design and construction ==\nThe reactor was designed and built by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company based on experimental designs tested by Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago, and tests from the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It was designed to operate at 250 megawatts (thermal).\nThe purpose of the reactor was to breed plutonium from natural (not isotopically enriched) uranium metal, as uranium enrichment was a difficult process, while plutonium is relatively simple to process chemically. The Y12 uranium enrichment plant required 14,700 tons of silver for its enrichment calutrons, as well as 22,000 employees and more electrical power than most entire states required at the time. Reactor B required only a few dozen employees and fewer exotic materials, which were also required in far smaller amounts. The largest part of the reactor was 1200 tons of graphite used as a moderator, and its power consumption was vastly smaller, requiring only enough electricity to run the cooling pumps.\nThe reactor occupies a footprint of 46 by 38 ft (14 by 12 m) (about 1,750 sq ft (163 m2) and is 41 ft (12 m) tall, occupying a volume of 71,500 cu ft (2,020 m3). The reactor core itself consisted of a 36 ft-tall (11 m) graphite box measuring 28 by 36 ft (8.5 by 11.0 m) occupying a volume of 36,288 cu ft (1,027.6 m3) and weighing 1,200 short tons (1,100 t). It was penetrated horizontally through its entire length by 2,004 aluminum tubes and vertically by channels for the vertical safety rods.\nThe core is surrounded by a thermal shield of cast iron 8 to 10 in (20 to 25 cm) thick weighing 1,000 short tons (910 t). Masonite and steel plates enclose the thermal shield on its top and sides, forming a biological shield for radiation protection. The bottom of the thermal shield is supported by a 23 ft-thick (7.0 m) concrete pad topped by cast-iron blocks. The graphite composition was selected to moderate the nuclear reaction fueled by 200 short tons (180 t) of uranium slugs approximately 25 mm (1 in) diameter 70 mm (3 in) long (the approximate size of a roll of quarters), sealed in aluminum cans, and loaded into the aluminum tubes.\nThe reactor was water-cooled, with cooling water pumped from the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River through the aluminum tubes around the uranium slugs at the rate of 75,000 US gal (280,000 L) per minute. The water was discharged into settling basins, then returned to the river after allowing time for the decay of radioactive materials, the settling out of particulate matter, and for the water to cool so it could be returned to the Columbia River. Water returning to the river was prohibited from raising the temperature of the river by more than 11 Â°F.\n\n\n== Operation ==\nThe B Reactor had its first nuclear chain reaction in September 1944, the D Reactor in December 1944 and the F Reactor in February 1945. The initial operation was halted by a problem identified as neutron absorption by the fission product Xe-135, first identified in a research paper of Chien-Shiung ', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'frequency_penalty': NOT_GIVEN, 'function_call': NOT_GIVEN, 'functions': NOT_GIVEN, 'logit_bias': NOT_GIVEN, 'logprobs': NOT_GIVEN, 'max_tokens': NOT_GIVEN, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': NOT_GIVEN, 'response_format': NOT_GIVEN, 'seed': NOT_GIVEN, 'stop': NOT_GIVEN, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'DynamicGraph'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'DynamicGraph', 'description': 'Represents a graph document consisting of nodes and relationships.', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'nodes': {'description': 'List of nodes', 'type': 'array', 'items': {'description': 'Represents a node in a graph with associated properties.', 'type': 'object', 'properties': {'id': {'description': 'Name or human-readable unique identifier.', 'type': 'string'}, 'type': {'description': "The type or label of the node.Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\nFor example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'Person'**.
