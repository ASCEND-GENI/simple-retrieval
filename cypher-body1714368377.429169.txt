Overview\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrifing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\naccessible for a vast audience.\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\'person\'**. Avoid using more specific terms like \'mathematician\' or \'scientist\'  - **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as \'BECAME_PROFESSOR\', use more general and timeless relationship types like \'PROFESSOR\'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\nIf an entity, such as "John Doe", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., "Joe", "he"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use "John Doe" as the entity ID.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n## 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.', 'role': 'system'}, {'content': 'Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: A boiling water reactor (BWR) is a type of light water nuclear reactor used for the generation of electrical power. It is the second most common type of electricity-generating nuclear reactor after the pressurized water reactor (PWR), which is also a type of light water nuclear reactor.\nThe main difference between a BWR and PWR is that in a BWR, the reactor core heats water, which turns to steam and then drives a steam turbine. In a PWR, the reactor core heats water, which does not boil. This hot water then exchanges heat with a lower pressure system, which turns water into steam that drives the turbine.\nThe BWR was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory and General Electric (GE) in the mid-1950s. The main present manufacturer is GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, which specializes in the design and construction of this type of reactor.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nA boiling water reactor uses demineralized water as a coolant and neutron moderator. Heat is produced by nuclear fission in the reactor core, and this causes the cooling water to boil, producing steam. The steam is directly used to drive a turbine, after which it is cooled in a condenser and converted back to liquid water. This water is then returned to the reactor core, completing the loop. The cooling water is maintained at about 75 atm (7.6 MPa, 1000–1100 psi) so that it boils in the core at about 285 °C (550 °F). In comparison, there is no significant boiling allowed in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) because of the high pressure maintained in its primary loop—approximately 158 atm (16 MPa, 2300 psi). The core damage frequency of the reactor was estimated to be between 10−4 and 10−7 (i.e., one core damage accident per every 10,000 to 10,000,000 reactor years).\n\n\n== Components ==\n\n\n=== Condensate and feedwater ===\n\nSteam exiting the turbine flows into condensers located underneath the low-pressure turbines, where the steam is cooled and returned to the liquid state (condensate). The condensate is then pumped through feedwater heaters that raise its temperature using extraction steam from various turbine stages. Feedwater from the feedwater heaters enters the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) through nozzles high on the vessel, well above the top of the nuclear fuel assemblies (these nuclear fuel assemblies constitute the "core") but below the water level.\nThe feedwater enters into the downcomer or annulus region and combines with water exiting the moisture separators. The feedwater subcools the saturated water from the moisture separators. This water now flows down the downcomer or annulus region, which is separated from the core by a tall shroud. The water then goes through either jet pumps or internal recirculation pumps that provide additional pumping power (hydraulic head). The water now makes a 180-degree turn and moves up through the lower core plate into the nuclear core, where the fuel elements heat the water. Water exiting the fuel channels at the top guide is saturated with a steam quality of about 15%. Typical core flow may be 45,000,000 kg/h (100,000,000 lb/h) with 6,500,000 kg/h (14,500,000 lb/h) steam flow. However, core-average void fraction is a significantly higher fraction (~40%). These sort of values may be found in each plant\'s publicly available Technical Specifications, Final Safety Analysis Report, or Core Operating Limits Report.\nThe heating from the core creates a thermal head that assists the recirculation pumps in recirculating the water inside of the RPV. A BWR can be designed with no recirculation pumps and rely entirely on the thermal head to recirculate the water inside of the RPV. The forced recirculation head from the recirculation pumps is very useful in controlling power, however, and allows achieving higher power levels that would not otherwise be possible. The thermal power level is easily varied by simply increasing or decreasing the forced recirculation flow through the recirculation pumps.\nThe two-phase fluid (water and steam) above the c', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'frequency_penalty': NOT_GIVEN, 'function_call': NOT_GIVEN, 'functions': NOT_GIVEN, 'logit_bias': NOT_GIVEN, 'logprobs': NOT_GIVEN, 'max_tokens': NOT_GIVEN, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': NOT_GIVEN, 'response_format': NOT_GIVEN, 'seed': NOT_GIVEN, 'stop': NOT_GIVEN, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0, 'tool_choice': {'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'DynamicGraph'}}, 'tools': [{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'DynamicGraph', 'description': 'Represents a graph document consisting of nodes and relationships.', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'nodes': {'description': 'List of nodes', 'type': 'array', 'items': {'description': 'Represents a node in a graph with associated properties.', 'type': 'object', 'properties': {'id': {'description': 'Name or human-readable unique identifier.', 'type': 'string'}, 'type': {'description': "The type or label of the node.Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\nFor example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'Person'**.
